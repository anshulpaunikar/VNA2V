## üì® Deliverable 1 - Spy Game [20 pts]

Consider the following
[spy](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/spy.html)-style plot of an
information matrix (i.e., coefficient matrix in Gauss-Newton‚Äôs normal equations) 
for a landmark-based SLAM problem where dark cells correspond to non-zero blocks:

![Spy Plot]( {{ 'assets/images/lab9/spy_game2.png' | absolute_url }}){: .mx-auto .d-block}

Assuming robot poses are stored
sequentially, answer the following questions:

1. How many robot poses exist in this problem?
2. How many landmarks exist in the map?
3. How many landmark have been observed by the current (last) pose?
4. Which pose has observed the most number of landmark?
5. What poses have observed the 2nd landmark?
6. Predict the sparsity pattern of the information matrix after marginalizing
   out the 2nd feature.
7. Predict the sparsity pattern of the information matrix after marginalizing
   out past poses (i.e., only retaining the last pose).
8. Marginalizing out which variable (chosen among both poses or landmarks) would
   preserve the sparsity pattern of the information matrix?
9. The following figures illustrate the robot (poses-poses) block of the
    information matrix obtained after marginalizing out (eliminating) all
    landmarks in bundle adjustment in two different datasets. What can you say
    about these datasets (e.g., was robot exploring a large building? Or perhaps
    it was surveying a small room? etc) given the spy images below?

## üì® Deliverable 2 - Well-begun is Half Done [10 pts]

Pose graph optimization is a non-convex problem. Therefore, iterative solvers
require a (good) initial guess to converge to the right solution. Typically, one
initializes nonlinear solvers (e.g., Gauss-Newton) from the odometric estimate
obtained by setting the first pose to the identity and chaining the odometric
measurements in the pose graph.

Considering that chaining more relative pose measurements (either odometry or
loop closures) accumulates more noise (and provides worse initialization),
propose a more accurate initialization method that also sets the first pose to
the identity but chains measurements in the pose graph in a more effective way.
A 1-sentence description and rationale for the proposed approach suffices.

> Hint: consider a graph with an arbitrary topology. Also, think about the
problem as a graph, where you fix the ‚Äúroot‚Äù node and initialize each node by
chaining the edges from the root to that node..

## üì® Deliverable 3 - Feature-based methods for SLAM [10 pts]

Read the ORB-SLAM paper (available
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10y8nTvUVB9C-hSaZmtX6772qTZt0LnX-)) and
answer the following questions:

1. Provide a 1 sentence description of each module used by ORB-SLAM (Fig. 1 in
   the paper can be a good starting point).
2. Consider the case in which the place recognition module provides an incorrect
   loop closure. How does ORB-SLAM check that each loop closure is correct? What
   happens if an incorrect loop closure is included in the pose-graph
   optimization module?

## üì® Deliverable 4 [Optional] - Direct methods for SLAM [+5 pts]

Read the LSD-SLAM paper (available
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Wjm0sp0U0SQ9gwZ6FTyVxOiruMGR2qwp), see
also the introduction below before reading the paper) and answer the following
questions:

1. Provide a 1 sentence description of each module used by LSD-SLAM and outline similarities and differences with respect to ORB-SLAM.
2. Which approach (between feature-based or direct) is expected to be more
   robust to changes in illumination or occlusions? Motivate your answer.

LSD-SLAM is a *direct method* for SLAM, as opposed to *feature-based* methods we
have worked with previously. As you know, feature-based methods detect and match
features (keypoints) in each image and then use 2-view geometry (and possibly
bundle adjustment) to estimate the motion of the robot. Direct methods are
different in the fact that they do not extract features, but can be easily
understood using the material presented in class.

In particular, the main difference is the way the 2-view geometry is solved. In
feature-based approaches one uses RANSAC and a minimal solver (e.g., the 5-point
method) to infer the motion from feature correspondences. In direct methods,
instead, one tries to estimate the relative pose between consecutive frames by
minimizing directly the mismatch of the pixel intensities between two images:

\\[ E(\xi) = \sum_i (I\_{ref}(p_i) - I(\omega (p_i, D\_{ref}(p_i), \xi)))^2
= r_i(\xi)^2
\\]

Where the objective looks for a pose $\xi$ (between the last frame $I\_{ref}$
 and the current frame $I$ that minimizes the mismatch between the intensity
 $I\_{ref}(p_i)$ at pixel $p_i$ for each pixel $p_i$ in the image, and intensity
 of the corresponding pixel in the current image $I$. How do we retrieve the
 pixel corresponding to $p_i$ in the current image $I$? In other words, what is
 this term?:
 
 \\[ I(\omega (p_i, D\_{ref}(p_i), \xi))\\]

It seems mysterious, but it‚Äôs nothing new: this simply represents a perspective
projection. More specifically, given a pixel $p_i$, if we know the corresponding
depth $D_{ref}(p_i)$ we can get a 3D point that we can then project to the
current camera as a function of the relative pose. The $\omega$ is typically
called a **warp function** since it "warps" a pixel in the previous frame
$I\_{ref}$ into a pixel at the current frame $I$. What is the catch? Well.. the
depth $D\_{ref}$ is unknown in practice, so you can only optimize $E(\xi)$ if at
a previous step you have some triangulation of the points in the image. In
direct methods, therefore these is typically an "initialization step": you use
feature-based methods to estimate the poses of the first few frames and
triangulate the corresponding points, and then you can use the optimization of
$E(\xi)$ to estimate later poses. The objective function $E(\xi)$ is called the
_photometric error_, which quantifies the difference in the pixel appearance
in consecutive frames.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE</span>**:
[LDSO](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YuVjojj3CsVFcOBo-IqUVELluz1vw9-t)
(Direct Sparse Odometry with Loop Closures) which you are going to use in Part 2
of this handout is simply an evolution of LSD-SLAM (by the same authors). We are
suggesting you to read the LSD-SLAM paper since it provides a simpler
introduction to direct methods, while we decided to use LDSO for the
experimental part since it comes with a more recent implementation.

## üì® Deliverable 5 [Optional] - From landmark-based SLAM to rotation estimation [+15 pts]

Consider the following landmark-based SLAM problem:

\\[ \min_{t_i \in \mathbb{R}^3,\ R_i \in \SO{3},\ p_i \in \mathbb{R}^3} \sum\_{(i,k) \in \mathcal{E}_l} \|\| R_i^T(p_k - t_i) - \bar{p}\_{ik} \|\|_2^2 + \sum\_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}_o} \|\|R_i^T(t_j - t_i) - \bar{t}\_{ij}\|\|_2^2 + \|\|R_j - R_i\bar{R}\_{ij}\|\|_F^2 \\]

Where the goal is to compute the poses of the robot $(t_i, R_i),\ i=1,\ldots,N$
and the positions of point-landmarks $p_k, k= 1, \ldots, M$ given odometric
measurements $(\bar{t}\_{ij}, \bar{R}\_{ij})$ for each odometric edge $(i,j) \in
\mathcal{E}_o$ (here $\mathcal{E}_o$ denotes the set of odometric edges), and
landmark observations $\bar{p}\_{ik}$ of landmark $k$ from pose $i$ for each
observation edge $(i,k) \in \mathcal{E}_l$ (here $\mathcal{E}_l$ denotes the set of
pose-landmark edges).

- Prove the following claim: "The optimization problem (1) can be rewritten as
   a nonlinear optimization over the rotations $R_i,\ i=1,\ldots,N$ only." Provide an expression of the resulting rotation-only problem to support the proof.

> Hint: (i) Euclidean norm is invariant under rotations, and (ii) translations/positions variables appear ...!
Consider also using a compact matrix notation to rewrite the sums in the cost
function otherwise it will be tough to get an expression of the rotation-only
problem

- The elimination of variables discussed at the previous point largely reduces
   the size of the optimization problem (from 6N+3L variables to 3N variables).
   However, the rotation problem is not necessarily faster to solve. Discuss
   what can make the rotation-only problem more computationally-demanding to
   solve.

> Hint: What property makes optimization-based SLAM algorithms fast to solve?

## ORB-SLAM

By now you should have ORB-SLAM installed, and you should be able to make it run
on the EuRoC dataset that we downloaded previously. You might be already
familiar with the visualization window of ORB-SLAM:

![ORBSLAM Viz]( {{ 'assets/images/lab9/orbslam.png' | absolute_url }}){: .mx-auto .d-block}

Let us now use ORB-SLAM to estimate the trajectory of the camera. For that, run
ORB-SLAM for the whole `MH_01_easy` EuRoC sequence ([available
here](http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/ijrr_euroc_mav_dataset/machine_hall/MH_01_easy/MH_01_easy.bag))
and wait for the `KeyFrameTrajectory_TUM_Format.txt` file, which contains the
estimated trajectory, to be generated (it will be generated when you `ctrl+c`
the process, which you should only do at the end of the rosbag).


## Kimera

[Kimera](http://web.mit.edu/sparklab/2019/10/13/Kimera__an_Open-Source_Library_for_Real-Time_Metric-Semantic_Localization_and_Mapping.html)
is an open-source library for real-time SLAM ([paper
here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02490.pdf)). Let's install Kimera and try out
its visual odometry system on the EuRoC dataset. Clone the [Github
repository](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO-ROS) into a catkin
workspace, following the instructions in the README for installation. Note: this
will build GTSAM, OpenCV, and OpenGV, so if you haven't already built these,
this might take a while (around 15 minutes), so this is a good time to grab a
coffee.

In general, you can build Kimera as follows:
```bash
cd ~/vna2v_ws/src/
git clone git@github.com:MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO-ROS.git
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends apt-utils
sudo apt-get install -y \
      cmake build-essential unzip pkg-config autoconf \
      libboost-all-dev \
      libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev \
      libvtk6-dev libgtk-3-dev \
      libatlas-base-dev gfortran \
      libparmetis-dev \
      python-wstool python-catkin-tools
sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
wstool merge Kimera-VIO-ROS/install/kimera_vio_ros_ssh.rosinstall
wstool update
# Here you might get some messages from wstool 
# Just make sure you don't duplicate the packages 
catkin build kimera_vio_ros
source ~/vna2v_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

You can run "online" or "offline" on the EuRoC dataset bag file (see
instructions in the Kimera README). In "online" mode, Kimera will subscribe to
incoming images (expecting topic names to be in the correct EuRoC bag format),
which will be provided when you separately `rosbag play` the appropriate bag
file, and output trajectory estimates as it runs. In "offline" mode, Kimera will
read directly from the bag file, processing messages one at a time.

To run online, simply run:
```bash
roslaunch kimera_vio_ros kimera_vio_ros_euroc.launch
```
Then, in another terminal run RViZ:
```bash
rviz -d $(rospack find kimera_vio_ros)/rviz/kimera_vio_euroc.rviz
```
Lastly, play the EuRoC `MH_01_easy` bag file:
```bash
rosbag play --clock /PATH/TO/EUROC_ROSBAG
```

Your RViZ window should now look something like this one:

![Kimera RViz]( {{ 'assets/images/lab9/kimera_vio.png' | absolute_url }}){: .mx-auto .d-block}

Check out an example of Kimera running on one of the EuRoC datasets (V1\_01)
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ynwilnrufjlt9dx/kimera_output.mp4?dl=0).

By default, Kimera will place the output data in the `Kimera-VIO-ROS/output_logs/Euroc`
directory. Look in this directory for the file `traj_vio.csv`. These are
the state estimates provided by the VIO system in Euroc format.

## üì® Deliverable 6 - Performance Comparison [60 pts]

Download and install [the EVO repo](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo), which
allows us to evaluate the quality of trajectory estimates. Feel free to read
the useful Wiki page, Readme, and even Jupyter notebooks! that the repo
provides.

For Kimera, you will want to delete the first row of the `traj_vio.csv`
file, as `evo` doesn't like the headers in this row. Note also that the Kimera poses are provided in EuRoC format, while the ORB-SLAM poses are provided in TUM format. To convert the Kimera poses to TUM format, simply run:
```bash
evo_traj euroc traj_vio.csv --save_as_tum
```

Now you can use the `evo_traj` tool to plot both trajectories for `MH_01_easy`.
Report this plot and comment on the differences that you see between
trajectories:

```bash
evo_traj tum KeyFrameTrajectory_TUM_Format.txt traj_vio.tum --plot
```

(Specify the correct path for each of your trajectory files)

In general, the trajectories output from different SLAM systems may use
different conventions for the world frame, so we have to align the trajectories
in order to compare them. This amounts to solving for the optimal (in the sense
of having the _best fit_ to the ground truth) $\SE{3}$ transformation of the
estimated trajectory. We've discussed these types of problems at length in
class, and we don't ask you to implement the alignment process in this lab.
Fortunately, tools like `evo` have already provided efficient implementations
that do this for us. Let's compare to the ground-truth pose data from the EuRoC
dataset next, taking into consideration this pose alignment. Grab the
ground-truth pose data `data.csv` from the `MH_01_easy.zip` file on the EuRoC
website
([here](http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/ijrr_euroc_mav_dataset/machine_hall/MH_01_easy/MH_01_easy.zip)).
The `data.csv` file is in the EuRoC format, so like with the Kimera data, first
use `evo_traj` to convert to TUM format. Next, run:
```bash
evo_traj tum KeyFrameTrajectory_TUM_Format.txt traj_vio.tum --ref data.tum --plot --align
```
Report this plot and comment on the differences that you see between
trajectories.

## üì® [Optional] Deliverable 7 - LDSO [+10 pts]

Based on LSD-SLAM, LDSO is a direct, yet sparse, formulation for SLAM. It is
also capable of handling loop closures.

Let us install the code for LDSO, to do that follow the `Readme.md` in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/tum-vision/LDSO).

In the same `Readme.md` there is an example on how to run this pipeline for the
EuRoC dataset. Detailed below for convenience:

```bash
cd ~/code/LDSO
./bin/run_dso_euroc preset=0 files=/my_path_to_data/EuRoC/MH_01_easy/mav0/cam0
```

(Replace `my_path_to_data` with your path to the data).

At this point, you should be able to see the following window:

![LDSO Viz]( {{ 'assets/images/lab9/ldso.png' | absolute_url }}){: .mx-auto .d-block}

LDSO will output by default the results in ‚Äú`./results.txt`‚Äù file in the same
folder where you ran the command. Alternatively, you can specify the output
folder by setting the flag `output` in the command line.

The results file will only be generated once the sequence has all been
processed. Let now the pipeline run over the `MH_01_easy `sequence and ensure
that the results file is present.

First of all, the output from LDSO seems to be wrongly formatted, as it has
spurious backspaces that should not be there. To remove those, you can do it as
you prefer but if you use vim you could do the following:
    1. Install vim: sudo apt-get install vim
    2. Open the file in vim: vim results.txt
    3. Type the following keys:
        1. :
        2. `%s/\ *\ /\ /g`
        3. :wq

It might look like a weird command, but it is simply saying, for all the lines
in the file (%), substitute (s/) all sequences of backspaces (\ *\ ) for (/)
only one backspace (\ ) for any repetition in the line (/g).

Plot the trajectory produced by LDSO with those of Kimera and ORB-SLAM and
comment on any differences in the trajectories

```bash
evo_traj tum KeyFrameTrajectory_TUM_Format.txt traj_vio.tum results.txt --ref data.tum --plot --align --correct_scale
```

Note, here since `LDSO` is a monocular method there is no way of recovering the
true scale of the scene, so we use the `--correct_scale` flag for `evo` to
estimate not just the $\SE{3}$ alignment of the predicted trajectory to the
ground-truth trajectory, but also the global scale factor.

Here's an example of the aligned trajectories plotted in the x-y plane (you can
add the flag `--plot_mode xy` to compare with this plot):

![Kimera Output]( {{ 'assets/images/lab9/example_kimera.png' | absolute_url }}){: .mx-auto .d-block}
