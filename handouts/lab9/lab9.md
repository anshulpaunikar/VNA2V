# Lab 9

# Introduction

Welcome to VNA2V Lab 9! This lab consists of the following parts:

- Part 1 [individual]: Pen and paper questions
- Part 2 [team]: Compare the performance of ORB-SLAM vs vs. Kimera vs. LDSO.

In Part 1, we will test your knowledge on some of the theory on SLAM. 

In Part 2, we will evaluate the differences between a keypoint-based SLAM
(ORB-SLAM) approach vs. another recent approach (Kimera), and optionally a
direct SLAM approach (LDSO).

If you struggle finding a solution or encounter problems/doubts during the
coding parts, please use Piazza to ask questions so your fellow classmates can
reuse the answers as well.
