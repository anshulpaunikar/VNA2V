# Lab 7

Welcome to VNA2V Lab 7! This lab consists of the following parts:


- Part 1 [individual]: Theoretical questions

- Part 2 [team]: Get familiar with GTSAM

In Part 1, we will test your knowledge on nonlinear least-squares and
maximum-likelihood estimation.

In Part 2, we will use GTSAM to formulate nonlinear least-squares problems and solve them.

If you struggle finding a solution or encounter problems/doubts during the
coding parts, please useâ€‹ Piazza to ask questions so your fellow classmates can
reuse the answers as well.
