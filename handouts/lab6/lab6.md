# Lab 6

Welcome to VNA2V Lab 6! This lab consists of the following parts:


Part 1 [individual]: Theoretical questions.

Part 2 [team]: Motion estimation of a drone using different algorithms.

In Part 1, we will test your knowledge on some of the theory of 2-view geometry.
In Part 2, we will have you use different vision-based pose estimation
algorithms to estimate the motion of a flying drone (we provide rosbag datasets).

If you struggle finding a solution or encounter problems/doubts during the
coding parts, please useâ€‹ Piazza to ask questions so your fellow classmates can
reuse the answers as well.
