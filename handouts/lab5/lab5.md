# Lab 5

This lab consists of:
- **Part 1 [individual]**: Theoretical questions
- **Part 2 [team]**: Get familiar with state-of-the-art feature tracking techniques

In Part 1, we will deal with theory related to perspective projection. In Part
2, we will have you try different feature tracking algorithms that are the basis
for many computer vision algorithms.

If you're having trouble or encounter problems during the implementation, feel
free to use Piazza to ask questions so your fellow classmates can respond and
benefit from the answers as well.
