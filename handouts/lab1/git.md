The following exercises are designed to help you to experiment and learn how these commands are used in practice.

## Getting started

1. Install Git with (requires internet connection). For this you need to update APT cache and then install the git-core package
2. Add your name/email to your Git configuration (system-wide)

```bash
git config --global user.name YOUR_NAME
git config --global user.email YOUR_UMICH_EMAIL_ADDRESS
```

3. [Generate](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair){:target="_blank"} SSH keys (do not forget the passphrase if you choose to set one)
4. [Add](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#adding-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account){:target="_blank"} SSH keys to your [gitlab.umich.edu account](https://gitlab.umich.edu/profile/keys){:target="_blank"}
5. [Create a new repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/#create-a-repository){:target="_blank"} on [https://gitlab.umich.edu](https://gitlab.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"}
6. Open a terminal and create a new directory using `mkdir` named `vna2v21` in your HOME directory
7. Clone your (empty) Git repo (earn street cred by calling by using "repo" instead of "repository")

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.umich.edu:USERNAME/REPO.git
```

## Merge Conflict with an Imaginary Collaborator

Now we simulate a common situation that arises when two or more people use the same repo.

1. Navigate to your repo and create new `me.txt` with **your name and UMICH email**, e.g.
```bash
$ cat me.txt
Jon Snow
lordsnow@umich.edu
```
2. Check the status with `git status`
3. Add (stage), check the status, commit and push your changes ‚Äì commit message can be "Added my email"
```bash
add me.txt
git status
git commit -m "Added my email"
git push
```
4. Inspect the log  with `git log` 

Now you can go to your repo‚Äôs page on Github and inspect the commit history and contents of your repo.

Let's continue editing the files
1. Let's create a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b new_branch_to_merge_later
```
2. Edit the file `me.txt` with completely different content, e.g.
```bash
$ cat me.txt
Arya Stark
astark@umich.edu
```
3. Add (stage), check the status, and commit your changes (you can push too if you want) ‚Äì commit message can be ‚ÄúSomebody added another email‚Äù
4. Now switch branch to master with `git checkout master`
5. Inspect the output of `git log --graph --oneline --all`
6. Append your course number to the file
```bash
$ echo "Course 16" >> me.txt
$ cat me.txt
Jon Snow
lordsnow@umich.edu
Course 16
```
6. Add (stage), check the status, and commit your changes ‚Äì commit message can be ‚ÄúAdded my course number‚Äù
7. Merge the two branches
```bash
$ git merge new_branch_to_merge_later
Auto-merging me.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in me.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

BOOM üí•. A conflict appears. Thanks, Git for letting us know about this!
Let's resolve the conflict

1. Inspect the file `me.txt`, you should see something like - Git helps us by marking the conflict region with special characters: `HEAD` refers to your current branch/commit and below the `=======` the other commit
```bash
$ cat me.txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
Jon Snow
lordsnow@umich.edu
Course 16
=======
Arya Stark
astark@umich.edu
>>>>>>> new_branch_to_merge_later
```
2.  In this case, we would like to have Jon name so we simply remove everything else (including `<<<<<<< HEAD`) from the file
3.  After resolving the conflict, it is time to stage our file and create our merge commit - inspect the log, see the diff, and check the status
```bash
git add me.txt
git commit -m "Merge commit"
git push
```
4. Inspect the output of `git log --graph --oneline --all`
5. Inspect the output of `git diff HEAD~2` - what does this command do?
